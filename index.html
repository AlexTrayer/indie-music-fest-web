        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p><strong>Independent music festivals</strong> provide essential platforms for emerging artists and offer a unique, community-focused experience distinct from mainstream commercial events. Often curated by music enthusiasts rather than large corporations, these festivals prioritize <strong>creative integrity</strong> and <strong>diverse lineups</strong> over mass appeal. They serve as crucibles for new trends and provide a space for music fans to discover niche genres and underground talent in intimate, often scenic, settings.</p>
